Greek Drama / Black Lives: Intergenerational Collaboration in Philadelphia is an ACLS sponsored project designed to restore and fortify relationships between Bryn Mawr College, the Community College of Philadelphia, and the E. M. Stanton School (K-8) in South Philadelphia.  The project encompasses a year of vibrant outreach programming culminating in a collaborative reimagination Euripides’ Medea, which centers questions of race and familial conflict, and the characters of Medea’s children.  This is “Greek theater through Black eyes”.
