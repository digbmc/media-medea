**Greek Drama/Black Lives: Intergenerational Collaboration in Philadelphia** is an ACLS sponsored project designed to restore and fortify relationships between Bryn Mawr College, the Community College of Philadelphia, and the E. M. Stanton School (K-8) in South Philadelphia.  The project encompasses a year of vibrant outreach programming culminating in a collaborative [reimagination Euripides’ Medea](play), which centers questions of race and familial conflict, and the characters of Medea’s children.  This is “Greek theater through Black eyes”.
